# Fed API Project

This is a **fed API project/test** where I retrieve data from an API and feed it to the UI as a display/showcase. The project demonstrates how to pull data from an external source and visualize it seamlessly in the frontend. 

The main objective is to connect to an API, fetch relevant information, and show it in the user interface.

Additionally, I use the **`react-chartjs-2`** library to visualize the fetched data through charts.
